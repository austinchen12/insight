At least 10 candidates for Congress or the Legislature face being taken off Indiana’s May primary ballot in the wake of a state Supreme Court order allowing enforcement of the [state’s two-primary voting standard](https://stateaffairs.com/indiana/elections/indiana-supreme-court-john-rust/) for Republican or Democratic candidates.

The most prominent of those at risk is John Rust, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate who challenged the constitutionality of the law.

Rust is the subject of several challenges filed with state election officials by Friday’s deadline. Also facing likely removal when the state Election Commission meets next week is a Democratic candidate for governor.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley will be listed on the Indiana ballot as no challenges were filed against her despite recent taunting from Donald Trump’s campaign that she wouldn’t gather the required petition signatures to qualify.
