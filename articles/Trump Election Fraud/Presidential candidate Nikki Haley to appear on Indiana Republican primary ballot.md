INDIANAPOLIS — Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, will join Donald Trump on the Republican primary ballot in the state of Indiana.

On Thursday, Haley’s campaign officially filed with the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office for placement on the Republican primary ballot as a presidential candidate in the state of Indiana.

This comes after Trump’s campaign alleged that Haley did not have the proper signatures to be on the ballot in Indiana, claiming that Marion County election officials may have been “improperly accepting petition signatures” from Haley’s campaign, [according to previous reports](https://fox59.com/indianapolitics/trump-campaign-alleges-petition-signatures-trouble-for-haley-ahead-of-indiana-deadline/?fbclid=IwAR2sYalRqVrJGDcQ3BJdHWszrgfFRmemzCdnH1Ero8uHenKFCM4HnoR1DPU).

Officials from the Marion County Board of Voters Registration reported to FOX59/CBS4 on Wednesday that Haley’s signatures had been verified in Marion County.

In a [post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1755691290069434454), Haley said that she is officially on the ballot in Indiana, with a picture of her paperwork accompanying the post.

According to previous reports, the deadline for candidates to file for a place on the primary ballot is at 12 p.m. on Friday, according to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office.
