## Topline

Ousted former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) sued Jimmy Kimmel, ABC and Disney this week, accusing the late-night host of fraud and copyright infringement after Kimmel’s team tricked Santos into making personalized videos on the app Cameo, where the ex-lawmaker claims he’s made hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## Key Facts

In December, Kimmel [launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyoRHDkJKlo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyoRHDkJKlo") a segment on his show called “Will Santos say it?” where he aired videos Santos made on Cameo in response to requests Kimmel had made using what the lawsuit—filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday—described as “fake user profiles” and “phony names and narratives.”

In the videos, Santos congratulates a non-existent fan for winning a meat-eating contest and congratulates another non-existent fan for cloning her dog, among other things, all based on requests Kimmel made through Cameo, which allows fans to pay for personalized messages from an array of celebrities and public figures.

But Santos alleges in his lawsuit Kimmel’s use of the videos infringed on Santos’ copyright, with Santos’ lawyers arguing Cameo’s terms of service do not permit users to broadcast videos on national television.

Santos also accuses Kimmel of fraud, claiming Kimmel misrepresented himself to obtain the videos “for the sole purpose of capitalizing on and ridiculing (Santos’) gregarious personality.”

Santos is seeking an injunction on the use of future videos, $150,000 in statutory damages related to each alleged copyright infringement, amounting to $750,000 over five videos, plus other unspecified actual and punitive damages.

Forbes has contacted ABC and Disney for comment.

## Chief Critic

In a statement to Forbes, Santos’ lawyer Andrew Mancilla said he believed Kimmel’s team “felt entitled to trample on George’s rights just because of his current legal issues,” calling the acton “not good form, and honestly not something you’d expect from a late-night comedy program that should appreciate the difference between humor derived from observation and humor derived from exploitation.”

## Contra

Kimmel had [previously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4SUO4Rlik "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4SUO4Rlik") laughed off the possibility of a lawsuit. In December, he ran the segment a second time and said Santos had demanded $20,000 in compensation after the first round of videos. He told his audience: “Could you imagine if I get sued by George Santos for fraud? I mean, how good would that be? It would be like a dream come true.”

After leaving Congress, he began posting videos on Cameo, where he says he’s made [more money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkRR2KF9zRw "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkRR2KF9zRw") than he did in Congress, where he earned a $174,000-a-year salary.
