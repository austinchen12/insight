Disgraced former congressman George Santos has [filed a lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.615855/gov.uscourts.nysd.615855.1.0.pdf) against [Jimmy Kimmel](https://consequence.net/tag/jimmy-kimmel/) for allegedly misusing his Cameo videos.

According to the [_New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/02/17/us-news/lyin-expelled-ex-rep-george-santos-makes-jimmy-kimmels-wishes-come-true-by-suing-host-over-misusing-cameo-clips/), Santos is seeking at least $750,000 in damages from the _Jimmy Kimmel Live!_ host for copyright infringement, breach of contract, and fraud. The lawsuit specifically accuses Kimmel of using fake aliases to solicit Cameo videos “for the sole purpose of capitalizing on and ridiculing \[Santos’\] gregarious personality.” Santos also claims that Kimmel failed to obtain the proper license to distribute his content on national television.

Santos, who is facing 23 felony counts related to fraud and money laundering, was expelled from Congress in December 2023. Following his expulsion, he launched a Cameo account and offered personalized video recordings.

Kimmel, using fake aliases, commissioned at least 14 Cameo requests from Santos, which he then showed on his late-night television show in a segment called “Will Santos Say It?” Santos subsequently sent Kimmel a cease and desist and demanded he pay $20,000 for the clips he had already aired.

“Can you imagine if I get sued by George Santos for fraud? How good would that be? It would be like a dream come true,” Kimmel joked in reaction to Santos’ legal threat.
