The [OpenAI](https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-sam-altman-openai-shock-firing-microsoft-switch-2023-11?r=US&IR=T) CEO is working to secure US government approval for the project as it risks raising national security and antitrust concerns, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/openai-s-altman-seeks-us-blessing-to-raise-billions-for-ai-chips).

Altman told potential investors that he can't move forward without Washington's approval, Bloomberg reported.

Altman's proposals are aimed at helping to solve the [global chip shortage](https://www.businessinsider.com/semiconductor-chips-jobs-hiring-arizona-tech-phoenix-tsmc-intel-china-2024-1), according to the reports. He's said to be presenting his pitch as a partnership with OpenAI, chip makers, and investors who can finance GPU chip plants, the report says.

Representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

[Jensen Huang](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-chipmaker-cofounder-ceo-wealth-net-worth-ai-2023-5), the CEO of leading chipmaker Nvidia, hasn't been overly positive about Altman's plan.

He told the United Arab Emirates' AI minister, Omar Al Olama, that developing [AI wouldn't cost as much](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-7-trillion-chip-dreams-off-mark-nvidia-ceo-2024-2) as the amount Altman was seeking to raise. 

Huang said: "There's about a trillion dollars' worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering software around the world."

He also took an indirect shot at Altman, joking that $7 trillion could buy "apparently all the GPUs."
