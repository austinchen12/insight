Welcome, folks, to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch’s regular newsletter covering noteworthy happenings in the tech industry.

This week, OpenAI stunned the blogosphere with the release of [Sora](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/openais-newest-model-can-generate-videos-and-they-look-decent/), a new AI model that can generate videos in impressively high fidelity. We’ve seen video generators before. But what makes Sora unique is its understanding of time and physics, which enable it to create not only more coherent videos than previous video generators, but also [3D worlds](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/openais-sora-video-generating-model-can-render-video-games-too/). Wild stuff!

Elsewhere, startup [Score](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/score-is-a-new-dating-app-for-people-with-good-to-excellent-credit/?mrfhud=true) released a dating app exclusive to people with good to excellent credit scores. And an anti-Tesla Super Bowl ad [came under fire](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/dawn-project-tesla-ad-fsd-ntsb/?mrfhud=true) from the National Transportation Safety Board for using its seal without authorization.

Lots else happened. We recap it all in this edition of WiR — but first, a reminder to [sign up](https://techcrunch.com/newsletters/) to receive the WiR newsletter in your inbox every Saturday.
