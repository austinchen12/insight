Every new OpenAI announcement sparks some measure of awe and terror. Late on Thursday, the maker of ChatGPT [dropped its latest new gizmo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/openai-unveils-ai-system-to-turn-text-into-realistic-videos), a text-to-video model called [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) that can create up to a minute of high-quality video. Cue a flood of remarkable AI clips going viral on social media, while stock video producers, filmmakers, actors and some startup founders likely fretted about their livelihoods.

AI video-generation has been around for more than a year, but Soraâ€™s examples, including a high-definition clip of [puppies shaking their fur](https://twitter.com/Mr_AllenT/status/1758230836275445949) in the snow and a sleepy woman [being woken up by her cat](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1758203473881956689), look more realistic than previous efforts. The glitches are harder to spot and the humans look more human.
